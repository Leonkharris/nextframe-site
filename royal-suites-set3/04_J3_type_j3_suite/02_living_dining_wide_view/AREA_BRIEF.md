# Spatial Preflight - J3 Living / Dining

Unit: Type J3 Suite
Shot folder: 04_J3_type_j3_suite\02_living_dining_wide_view
Source floor plan: ..\..\04_J3_type_j3_suite\00_source_floor_plan.jpg

## Preflight Assets

- Full plan with target highlight: plan_highlight.png
- Cropped target zone: target_crop.png

## Target Area

Approximate crop size from plan scale: **3.26 m x 5.48 m**.
Approximate position within whole unit plan: **0% from left**, **0% from top**.

What is inside the cropped/highlighted area:
Left-side vertical stack: kitchen below, dining middle-left, living/sofa upper-left by the top/north window wall. Right-side rooms remain enclosed.

## Camera Intent

Eye-level from lower-left kitchen/dining side toward living and top window wall; never overhead.

## Prompt Engineering Handoff Rules

- Use target_crop.png as the primary spatial reference for this shot.
- Use plan_highlight.png to confirm the target zone's relationship to the whole unit.
- Do not invent walls, windows, doors, islands, balconies, corridors, or room separations not supported by the crop and full plan.
- Use one single upright 9:16 real-estate photograph, human eye height, not top-down, not collage, not a presentation board.
- Keep adjacent zones visible only if they are naturally visible from the crop and camera intent.

## Accuracy Gate Before Generation

Pass this checklist before handing off to image generation:

- [ ] Target crop matches the requested shot title.
- [ ] The prompt describes the correct room/zone and not a neighboring room.
- [ ] Approximate room scale is preserved from the crop.
- [ ] Door/window positions are not moved or invented.
- [ ] Camera is eye-level unless this is explicitly an isometric plan shot.
- [ ] No split-frame, collage, overhead, dollhouse, or rotated output is requested.
- [ ] Any visible adjacent area is supported by the full highlighted plan.

## Post-Generation Accuracy Check

After generation, reject the image if:

- It shows a different room or wrong unit zone.
- It uses top-down, dollhouse, overhead, rotated, or collage composition.
- It adds a kitchen island, glass floor, balcony, corridor, bedroom wall, or extra room not shown in the crop.
- It moves window/door locations in a way that contradicts the highlighted plan.
- It scores below 8/10 for floor-plan fidelity.
